Analyze this codebase to generate a new AGENTS.md file in project root for guiding AI coding agents.

Focus on discovering the essential knowledge that would help AI agents be immediately productive in this codebase.
Consider aspects like:

- The "big picture" architecture that requires reading multiple files to understand - major components, service
  boundaries, data flows, and the "why" behind structural decisions
- Critical developer workflows (builds, tests, debugging) especially commands that aren't obvious from file inspection
  alone
- Project-specific conventions and patterns that differ from common practices
- Integration points, external dependencies, and cross-component communication patterns

Source existing AI conventions from *
*/{.github/copilot-instructions.md,AGENT.md,AGENTS.md,CLAUDE.md,.cursorrules,.windsurfrules,.clinerules,.cursor/rules/**
,.windsurf/rules/**,.clinerules/**,README.md} (do one glob search).

Guidelines (read more at <https://agents.md/>):

- Write concise, actionable instructions (~20-50 lines) using markdown structure
- Include specific examples from the codebase when describing patterns
- Avoid generic advice ("write tests", "handle errors") - focus on THIS project's specific approaches
- Document only discoverable patterns, not aspirational practices
- Reference key files/directories that exemplify important patterns

Generate AGENTS.md first. After creating it, summarize what was included so the user is aware of the content.
